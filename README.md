# Coffee-Machine
project from my CIS 254 class

# Original Instructions
Create a program simulating a coffee machine. The machine has 3 options: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. A customer can order their coffee in three sizes: small, medium, and large. Using a switch statement, ask the user to enter in a coffee type and size, then display the coffee order.

# Additional Requirements
- Covers user input regardless of strange casing
- Stores size question in separate method
- Invalid input does not crash the code
